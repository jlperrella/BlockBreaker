Block Breaker Game

This is a simple block breaker style game built with Unity4 via Ben Tristem's Complete Unity Developer course on Udemy.
The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of the Unity editor and create a working game writing all script from scratch.

Game script can be found in BlockBreaker/Assets/Scripts
